# 🧠 Zero to Mastery: Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

Welcome to my project portfolio from the [Zero to Mastery Machine Learning and Data Science Bootcamp](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp/) by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Bourke. This repository contains hands-on projects that demonstrate my learning and application of key concepts in data science and machine learning.

## 📚 Course Overview

This comprehensive course covers:

- **Python Programming**: Fundamentals and advanced concepts
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised and unsupervised techniques with Scikit-Learn
- **Deep Learning**: Building neural networks with TensorFlow 2.0
- **Project Deployment**: Sharing and communicating results effectively

For more details, refer to the [official course repository](https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml).

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Each project is organized as follows:

```
